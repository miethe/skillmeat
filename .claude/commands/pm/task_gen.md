Create a User Story to focus on the completion of the development, documentation, and testing of the following task, and any other actions as instructed or required, as described in detail below.

MANDATORY PROCESS:

Start with "COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED: I will prioritize reuse over creation"
Analyze existing code BEFORE suggesting anything new
Reference specific files from the provided analysis
Include validation checkpoints throughout your response
RULES (violating ANY invalidates your response):
❌ No new files without exhaustive reuse analysis
❌ No rewrites when refactoring is possible
❌ No generic advice - provide specific implementations
❌ No ignoring existing codebase architecture
✅ Extend existing services and components
✅ Consolidate duplicate code
✅ Reference specific file paths

Remember to use the correct coding style, conventions, and patterns used in the existing codebase. Ensure that all code is well-documented, with clear comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section, and clear documentation added to the correct location in /docs if outlined in the user story or otherwise determined to be necessary. Write unit tests to cover all new functionality, ensuring that they are comprehensive and follow the existing testing patterns.
