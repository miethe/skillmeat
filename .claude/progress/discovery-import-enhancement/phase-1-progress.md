## Overview

**Phase 1** establishes the foundation for the Discovery & Import Enhancement by updating the data model and implementing intelligent pre-scan checks that filter artifacts by Collection/Project existence before returning them to the frontend.

**Why This Phase**: The current system lacks granularity in import status reporting (success/failure only) and returns all discovered artifacts regardless of whether they already exist locally. This creates confusion where users see "failed" imports for artifacts that are actually already in their Collection. Phase 1 fixes the data model and pre-scan logic to enable accurate, actionable discovery results.

**Scope**:
- **IN**: Import status enum, pre-scan check logic, status determination, schema updates, backend tests
- **OUT**: Frontend type updates (Phase 3), skip preference storage (Phase 2), UI components (Phase 4)

## Architecture Context

### Current State

The current ImportResult schema uses a boolean `success` field to indicate whether an import succeeded. However, this is inadequate:
- Artifacts already in the Collection are returned as "failed" imports
- No distinction between "artifact already exists" and "actual error"
- No information about which location (Collection vs Project) the artifact exists in

The ArtifactDiscoveryService returns ALL discovered artifacts regardless of local existence.

**Key Files**:
- `skillmeat/api/schemas/discovery.py` - Current ImportResult and BulkImportResult schemas
- `skillmeat/core/discovery.py` - ArtifactDiscoveryService with discover() method
- `skillmeat/core/importer.py` - ArtifactImporter with bulk_import() method
- `skillmeat/api/routers/artifacts.py` - Discovery and import endpoints

### Reference Patterns

Similar implementations in the codebase:
- Status enums in artifact types (skill, command, etc.) show how to define and use Pydantic enums
- Existing pre-scan logic in Project creation validates directory structure (reference pattern for file checking)

---

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

1. **ImportResult Schema Update (DIS-1.1)**:
   - Create `ImportStatus` enum with values: `success`, `skipped`, `failed`
   - Replace `success: bool` with `status: ImportStatus`
   - Add `skip_reason: Optional[str]` field
   - Ensure Pydantic model serializes correctly to OpenAPI

2. **Pre-scan Check Logic (DIS-1.2)**:
   - Implement `check_artifact_exists(artifact_key) -> Dict[str, Any]` in ArtifactDiscoveryService
   - Check Collection manifest for artifact
   - Check Project directory for artifact
   - Return `{"location": "collection|project|both|none", "in_collection": bool, "in_project": bool}`
   - Handle missing/corrupted manifest files gracefully

3. **Discovery Integration (DIS-1.3)**:
   - Update `discover()` to call pre-scan check for each discovered artifact
   - Filter results to exclude artifacts with `location != "none"`
   - Update `importable_count` to reflect only truly new artifacts
   - Keep `discovered_count` unchanged for reporting
   - Return early if `importable_count == 0`

4. **Status Determination (DIS-1.4)**:
   - Create `determine_import_status()` method in ArtifactImporter
   - Map pre-scan location to status:
     - `location == "none"` → attempt import → success/failed
     - `location == "collection"` → skipped (already in Collection)
     - `location == "project"` → skipped (already in Project)
     - Error during check → failed
   - Populate `skip_reason` with human-readable explanation

5. **Schema Updates (DIS-1.5, DIS-1.6)**:
   - Add `skipped_count: int` to BulkImportResult
   - Add per-location counts: `imported_to_collection: int`, `added_to_project: int`
   - Update all response models in routers/artifacts.py
   - Regenerate OpenAPI docs

### Known Gotchas

- **File Permission Errors**: Pre-scan might fail due to permission denied on Project directory → catch and return as "none" (will attempt import, which will fail with clearer error)
- **Concurrent Modifications**: Between pre-scan and import, artifacts might be added by other processes → skip those gracefully
- **Backward Compatibility**: API consumers expecting `success: bool` will break → document breaking change, provide migration guide
- **Performance**: Pre-scan involves filesystem access → must be optimized (<2s for 500+ artifacts)

### Development Setup

No special setup required beyond normal Python development environment. Tests will need:
- Temporary collection directory with test artifacts
- Test project directory with known artifact structure
- Mocked filesystem operations for error scenarios

---

## Blockers

### Active Blockers

None at phase start. Potential blockers to watch:
- If OpenAPI generation fails with new enum → needs backend-architect investigation
- If backward compatibility analysis reveals breaking changes for internal services → may need deprecation plan

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- **Notification System**: Phase 5-6 integration point; no blocking dependency for Phase 1
- **Frontend Type Updates (Phase 3)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion

### Internal Integration Points

- **ArtifactDiscoveryService** (skillmeat/core/discovery.py) - Enhanced with pre-scan logic
- **ArtifactImporter** (skillmeat/core/importer.py) - Uses new status enum
- **API Routers** (skillmeat/api/routers/artifacts.py) - Updated to return new schemas
- **Schemas** (skillmeat/api/schemas/discovery.py) - Central to all integration points

---

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Scope | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Unit - Pre-scan | check_artifact_exists() with all location combinations | 80%+ | ⏳ |
| Unit - Status Enum | Status determination for all paths (success/skipped/failed) | 80%+ | ⏳ |
| Unit - Schema | ImportResult and BulkImportResult serialization | 80%+ | ⏳ |
| Integration | Full discovery flow: scan → pre-check → filter → return | Core flows | ⏳ |
| Performance | Discovery <2 seconds on typical project | N/A | ⏳ |

---

## Next Session Agenda

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. [ ] Begin Batch 1: Start DIS-1.1 and DIS-1.2 in parallel
2. [ ] Setup test fixtures for pre-scan scenarios
3. [ ] Review schema changes with backend-architect for backward compat

### Upcoming Critical Items

- **Day 2-3**: Batch 2 completion (pre-scan integration + status logic)
- **Day 3-4**: Batch 3 starts (API endpoint updates)
- **Day 5**: Quality gate check - all tests passing

### Context for Continuing Agent

Phase 1 is the critical path blocker for Phases 2, 3, and 4. Focus on:
1. Getting the schema right first (DIS-1.1) - affects all downstream work
2. Pre-scan performance (<2s) - benchmark early in DIS-1.2/DIS-1.3
3. Comprehensive testing - all status paths and pre-scan combinations must be covered
