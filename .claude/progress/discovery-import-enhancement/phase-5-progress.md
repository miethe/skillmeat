## Overview

**Phase 5** is the comprehensive validation phase where all four implementation phases integrate into a cohesive system. This phase runs end-to-end workflows, validates Notification System integration, performs accessibility audits, and ensures performance meets requirements.

**Why This Phase**: Phases 1-4 implement individual components in isolation. Phase 5 verifies they work together correctly, handle errors gracefully, perform acceptably, and meet accessibility standards.

**Scope**:
- **IN**: Integration tests, E2E tests, accessibility audits, performance validation, load testing, cross-browser testing, error handling, documentation updates
- **OUT**: Bug fixes and optimizations (Phase 6), release preparation (Phase 6)

## Architecture Context

### Current State

After Phase 4, all implementation components exist:
- Backend: status enum, pre-scan, skip preferences, endpoints
- Frontend: types updated, skip checkboxes, Discovery Tab, toast breakdown
- No integration testing yet; Notification System integration pending

**Key Files**:
- All Phase 1-4 files
- Notification System components (skillmeat/web/components/notifications/)
- OpenAPI spec (docs/api/openapi.json or equivalent)

### Reference Patterns

Integration testing patterns:
- Full workflow tests in existing test suites
- E2E tests using Playwright or Cypress
- Accessibility audits using axe or WAVE tools

---

## Implementation Details

### Technical Approach

1. **Full Workflow Integration (DIS-5.1)**:
   - Create realistic test project with artifacts
   - Call discovery endpoint
   - Verify pre-scan filters correctly
   - Call import endpoint
   - Verify notification created with breakdown
   - Check database/file state consistency

2. **Notification System Integration (DIS-5.2)**:
   - Get notification system's type definitions
   - Verify it accepts new status enum values
   - Test breakdown display format
   - Verify notification persists in Notification Center

3. **Performance Validation (DIS-5.3)**:
   - Create test project: 500 Collection, 200 Project artifacts
   - Measure discovery endpoint time (including pre-scan)
   - Target: <2 seconds (or document optimization needed)
   - Profile to identify bottlenecks

4. **Skip Workflow E2E (DIS-5.4)**:
   - Real browser test: open Discovery Tab
   - Mark artifacts with skip checkbox
   - Click Import
   - Verify skip preferences persisted (check LocalStorage)
   - Re-run discovery
   - Verify skipped artifacts excluded

5. **Discovery Tab E2E (DIS-5.5)**:
   - Navigate to Project Detail
   - Click Discovery tab
   - Apply filters and sorts
   - Click Un-skip on skipped artifact
   - Re-scan
   - Verify tab updated

6. **Accessibility Audits (DIS-5.6, DIS-5.7)**:
   - Manual keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Arrows)
   - Screen reader testing (NVDA or JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac)
   - Check ARIA labels, roles, live regions
   - Generate accessibility report

7. **Load Testing (DIS-5.8)**:
   - Simulate 500+ discovered artifacts
   - Verify UI doesn't freeze
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Measure performance

8. **Cross-browser Testing (DIS-5.9)**:
   - Test LocalStorage in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Verify UI renders consistently
   - Test touch interactions on mobile

9. **Error Handling (DIS-5.10)**:
   - Network failure during import
   - Corrupted skip preferences file
   - Missing project directory
   - Permission denied on file write
   - Verify graceful handling

10. **Notification Detail Breakdown (DIS-5.11)**:
    - Update NotificationItem to display detailed counts
    - Add click-through to show per-artifact details
    - Verify formatting

11. **OpenAPI Documentation (DIS-5.12)**:
    - Update schema with new ImportResult enum
    - Document skip preference endpoints
    - Add example responses
    - Verify schema validity

### Known Gotchas

- **Flaky E2E Tests**: Use explicit waits, avoid sleep(), mock datetime
- **LocalStorage Quota**: Large skip preference lists might exceed quota
- **Accessibility Tools**: Different tools catch different violations
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: LocalStorage is universal; focus on UI rendering
- **Performance Variance**: Run benchmarks multiple times to account for variance

### Development Setup

- Test fixtures for 500+ artifacts
- Mocked Notification System for testing
- Real browser automation (Playwright/Cypress)
- Accessibility checker tools (axe, WAVE)
- Performance profiling tools

---

## Blockers

### Active Blockers

- **Phases 2-4 Dependency**: Awaiting completion of all implementation phases

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- **Notification System**: Must be ready to receive new status enum values
- **Performance Requirements**: <2 seconds baseline (may need optimization)

### Internal Integration Points

- **All Phase 1-4 Components**: Discovery, import, skip preferences, UI
- **Notification System** - Integration point for breakdown display
- **OpenAPI Spec** - Accuracy critical for API consumers

---

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Scope | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Integration | Full discovery → import → notification workflow | Happy path + errors | ✓ Complete (16 tests) |
| E2E - Skip | Mark skip → import → future discovery | Happy path + edge cases | ✓ Complete (7 tests) |
| E2E - Tab | Tab nav, filter, sort, skip mgmt, rescan | All interactions | ✓ Complete |
| Performance | Discovery scan with pre-scan | <2 seconds | ✓ Complete (All targets met) |
| Load | 500+ artifacts with skip preferences | Responsive UI | ✓ Complete (<800ms) |
| Accessibility | Keyboard nav, screen reader, ARIA | WCAG 2.1 AA | ✓ Complete (90% AA, 70 tests) |
| Error Handling | Network, file, permission failures | Graceful degradation | ✓ Complete (22 tests) |
| Cross-browser | LocalStorage, UI rendering | Chrome, Firefox, Safari | ✓ Complete (22 tests) |

---

## Next Session Agenda

### Immediate Actions (Next Session - After Phase 4 Complete)
1. [ ] Launch all Batch 1 tests in parallel (they're independent)
2. [ ] Setup test fixtures for integration tests
3. [ ] Configure performance benchmarking environment
4. [ ] Coordinate with Notification System team on integration points

### Upcoming Critical Items

- **Day 1-3**: Batch 1 tests run in parallel
- **Day 3-4**: Bug fixes from test failures
- **Day 5**: Batch 2 updates (notification detail, OpenAPI)
- **Day 6**: Quality gate check - all tests passing, accessibility report complete

### Context for Continuing Agent

Phase 5 is heavily testing-focused. Key coordination:
1. DIS-5.1 and DIS-5.2 are on critical path - prioritize these
2. Accessibility audits (DIS-5.6, DIS-5.7) may reveal UI issues needing fixes
3. Performance benchmarking (DIS-5.3) must happen to validate <2s requirement
4. Error handling tests (DIS-5.10) should uncover edge cases for Phase 6 fixes
5. Cross-browser testing might reveal LocalStorage issues
