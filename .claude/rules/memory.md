# Memory Rule (Global)

Invariant:

1. Before substantial implementation tasks, check for relevant project memories:
   `skillmeat memory search "<domain keywords>" --project <id> --json`
2. After completing features or debugging sessions with reusable learnings, capture via:
   `skillmeat memory extract preview --project <id> --run-log <path>`
3. Never auto-promote extracted memories — keep as `candidate` until human review.
4. For full memory workflows, use `skillmeat-cli` skill (Memory & Context handling policy).
