# Component Rule (Pointer)

Path scope: `skillmeat/web/components/**/*.tsx`

Use `.claude/context/key-context/component-patterns.md` for full component conventions.

Invariants:
- Never edit `skillmeat/web/components/ui/` primitives directly.
- Keep accessibility explicit (labels, keyboard/focus behavior).
