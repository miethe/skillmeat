# Document Frontmatter Improvement Spec (Future Schema)

Last updated: 2026-02-19
Status: Proposed

This spec defines a recommended structure for documentation frontmatter so CCDash can ingest richer, higher-quality data for linking, filtering, analytics, and lifecycle tracking.

This document is intentionally forward-looking and includes fields not currently required by the app.

## 1. Design Goals

- Improve entity linking precision (`document <-> feature/task/session/document`).
- Make documents consistently filterable across type, status, owners, release, risk, and outcome.
- Enable timeline and delivery analytics without parsing free-form markdown.
- Preserve backward compatibility with existing frontmatter styles.

## 2. Shared Envelope (Recommended for All Doc Types)

Use this baseline in every doc:

```yaml
schema_name: ccdash_document
schema_version: 2

doc_type: implementation_plan   # enum: prd|implementation_plan|phase_plan|report|progress|spec|design_doc|spike|bug_doc|document
doc_subtype: ""                # optional subtype for finer categorization
root_kind: project_plans        # enum: project_plans|progress

id: DOC-optional-stable-id      # optional stable ID (canonical path remains source of truth)
title: ""
status: draft                   # enum: draft|pending|in_progress|review|completed|deferred|blocked|archived
category: ""

feature_slug: ""
feature_version: ""            # e.g. v1, v2
feature_family: ""             # canonical/versionless slug
prd_ref: ""                    # slug/path/id
plan_ref: ""                   # slug/path/id
related_documents: []           # list[path|id]
related_features: []            # list[slug]
linked_sessions: []             # list[session-id]

confidence: 0.0                 # 0..1

created: ""                    # ISO timestamp

## 4. Recommended Rollout

1. Add `schema_name` and `schema_version` to all new docs.
2. Add shared envelope fields to templates first.
3. Backfill type-specific fields incrementally per directory.
4. Introduce validation tooling (lint) to prevent drift.
5. Expand DB columns only for high-value stable fields; keep long-tail data in `metadata_json`.

## 5. Validation Rules (Recommended)

- `doc_type`, `status`, `root_kind` must be enum values.
- `feature_slug` should be kebab-case and versioned when applicable.
- `phase`/`phase_token` should be numeric for phase docs.
- Task counters should be internally consistent (`completed <= total`, etc.).
- IDs in `linked_sessions` and `request_log_ids` should match known formats.
