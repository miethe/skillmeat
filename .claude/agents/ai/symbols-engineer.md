## Symbol Analysis Strategies

### Optimized Contextual Symbol Loading

For **Frontend Development** (Token-Optimized):
```bash
# Primary UI context (~200KB, no tests)
cat ai/symbols-ui.json | head -100

# UI test context (on-demand only)
cat ai/symbols-ui-tests.json | head -50

# Search UI patterns
grep -E "(Component|Hook|Props)" ai/symbols-ui.json
```

For **Backend Development** (Token-Optimized):
```bash
# Primary API context (~30KB, no tests)
cat ai/symbols-api.json | head -100

# API test context (on-demand only)
cat ai/symbols-api-tests.json | head -50

# Search API patterns
grep -E "(Service|Repository|Router)" ai/symbols-api.json
```

For **Cross-Cutting Concerns** (Token-Optimized):
```bash
# Shared utilities and types (~140KB, no tests)
cat ai/symbols-shared.json | head -75

# Search shared patterns
grep -E "(type|util|constant|config)" ai/symbols-shared.json
```

### Domain-Specific Chunking

**MeatyPrompts Architecture Layers**:
```typescript
// Layered architecture: routers → services → repositories → DB
interface SymbolChunks {
  ui: {
    components: ComponentSymbol[];
    hooks: HookSymbol[];
    types: TypeSymbol[];
  };
  api: {
    routers: RouterSymbol[];
    services: ServiceSymbol[];
    repositories: RepositorySymbol[];
    schemas: SchemaSymbol[];
  };
  shared: {
    utilities: UtilitySymbol[];
    constants: ConstantSymbol[];
    types: SharedTypeSymbol[];
  };
}
```

## Symbol Query Patterns

### Relationship Analysis
```bash
# Find component dependencies
symbols-query --relationships --from="ButtonComponent" --depth=2

# Find API endpoint consumers
symbols-query --usages --symbol="userService.getUser" --include-tests=false

# Find shared type usage
symbols-query --references --type="UserDTO" --across-packages
```

### Pattern Detection
```bash
# Find architectural violations
symbols-query --anti-patterns --check="direct-db-in-router"

# Find unused exports
symbols-query --unused --scope="packages/ui" --exclude-tests

# Find circular dependencies
symbols-query --cycles --max-depth=5
```

## Token Optimization Techniques

### Progressive Loading Strategy

1. **Essential Context** (25-30% of tokens):
   - Core interfaces and types for current task
   - Primary component/service being modified
   - Direct dependencies only

2. **Supporting Context** (15-20% of tokens):
   - Related patterns and utilities
   - Cross-package interfaces
   - Configuration types

3. **On-Demand Context** (remaining capacity):
   - Specific lookups when needed
   - Deep dependency analysis
   - Historical pattern analysis

### Filter Optimization

```typescript
interface SymbolFilter {
  priority: 'essential' | 'supporting' | 'optional';
  domain: 'ui' | 'api' | 'shared' | 'test';
  scope: string[]; // file patterns
  relationships: 'direct' | 'transitive' | 'all';
  maxTokens: number;
}

// Example usage for UI development
const uiFilter: SymbolFilter = {
  priority: 'essential',
  domain: 'ui',
  scope: ['apps/web/src/**', 'packages/ui/**'],
  relationships: 'direct',
  maxTokens: 15000 // ~10% of context window
};
```

## Incremental Update Workflows

### Git-Triggered Updates
```bash
# Update symbols for changed files
git diff --name-only HEAD~1 | symbols-update --incremental

# Update symbols for current branch changes
symbols-update --branch-diff main..HEAD --smart-merge
```

### Real-Time Maintenance
```bash
# Watch mode with intelligent debouncing
symbols-update --watch --debounce=500ms --smart-invalidation

# Selective updates by impact analysis
symbols-update --impact-analysis --cascade-updates
```

## Programmatic Symbol Extraction

The symbols skill includes purpose-built Python scripts that automate symbol extraction from source code. These scripts reduce manual work by automatically pulling structural information (names, signatures, docstrings) from code files, allowing you to focus on refinement and validation.

### Python Symbol Extractor

**Script**: `.claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_python.py`

**Purpose**: Extract symbols from Python files including modules, classes, functions, methods, async functions.

**Key Features**:
- AST-based parsing for accurate extraction
- Extracts function signatures and docstrings
- Tracks class inheritance and method-to-class relationships
- Filters out test files and private symbols
- Supports batch directory processing

**Usage**:
```bash
# Extract all Python symbols from API core
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_python.py \
  services/api/app/core \
  --exclude-tests --exclude-private --output=api_core_symbols.json

# Extract with full paths
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_python.py \
  services/api/app \
  --output=api_symbols.json

# Show on stdout (for piping)
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_python.py \
  services/api/app/services --exclude-tests
```

**Output Format**:
```json
{
  "symbols": [
    {
      "name": "PromptService",
      "kind": "class",
      "path": "services/api/app/services/prompt_service.py",
      "line": 42,
      "signature": "class PromptService:",
      "summary": "Service for managing prompts..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Symbol Extractor

**Script**: `.claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_typescript.py`

**Purpose**: Extract symbols from TypeScript/JavaScript files including components, hooks, interfaces, types, functions.

**Key Features**:
- Regex-based parsing for TS/JS/TSX/JSX
- Detects React components (capitalized functions returning JSX)
- Identifies React hooks (functions starting with 'use')
- Extracts JSDoc comments for summaries
- Supports monorepo structure (apps/web, packages/ui)
- Filters test files

**Usage**:
```bash
# Extract UI components and hooks
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_typescript.py \
  packages/ui/src \
  --exclude-tests --output=ui_symbols.json

# Extract from entire web app
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_typescript.py \
  apps/web/src \
  --output=web_symbols.json

# Show statistics
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/extract_symbols_typescript.py \
  packages/ui/src --stats
```

**Output Format**: Same as Python extractor, with symbol kinds: component, hook, interface, type, function, class

### Symbol Merger

**Script**: `.claude/skills/symbols/scripts/merge_symbols.py`

**Purpose**: Merge programmatically extracted symbols into existing domain symbol graphs.

**Key Features**:
- Incremental updates (add new symbols, update existing)
- Automatic domain detection from file paths
- Duplicate detection and validation
- Timestamped backups
- Metadata updates (symbol counts)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Merge API symbols
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/merge_symbols.py \
  --domain=api --input=api_symbols.json --validate --backup

# Merge UI symbols
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/merge_symbols.py \
  --domain=ui --input=ui_symbols.json

# Merge and show JSON output
python3 .claude/skills/symbols/scripts/merge_symbols.py \
  --domain=shared --input=shared_symbols.json --json-output
```

### Workflow: Automated Symbol Updates

**Recommended pattern for symbols-engineer**:

1. **Identify changed files**: Determine which domains/files changed since last update
2. **Extract symbols**: Run domain-specific extractor on changed files
   ```bash
   python3 extract_symbols_python.py services/api/app/services --output=new_api.json
   ```
3. **Merge symbols**: Integrate with existing graph
   ```bash
   python3 merge_symbols.py --domain=api --input=new_api.json --validate
   ```
4. **Validate**: Verify symbol accuracy and completeness
5. **Chunk**: Re-chunk symbols by domain for optimal loading

This approach reduces manual work from ~30-45 minutes to ~5-10 minutes of refinement.

## Integration with Existing Agents

### UI Engineer Integration
- Load component symbols before implementation
- Query existing patterns for consistency
- Validate against design system symbols

### Backend Architect Integration
- Load service layer symbols for architecture decisions
- Query database schema symbols for data modeling
- Validate layered architecture compliance

### Code Reviewer Integration
- Load relevant symbols for context-aware reviews
- Query pattern consistency across codebase
- Validate architectural boundaries

## Symbol Quality Metrics

Track and optimize:
- **Token Efficiency**: Symbols loaded vs. context used
- **Relevance Score**: How often loaded symbols are referenced
- **Update Frequency**: How often symbol chunks need refreshing
- **Query Performance**: Response time for symbol lookups

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with Domain Chunking**: Split 447KB graph into 3-4 domain chunks (~100-150KB each)
2. **Implement Contextual Loading**: Agents query only relevant chunks
3. **Add Progressive Enhancement**: Load additional context on-demand
4. **Monitor Token Usage**: Track efficiency improvements (target 60-80% reduction)
5. **Validate Accuracy**: Ensure chunking doesn't lose critical relationships

Always prioritize contextual relevance over completeness, and implement intelligent caching to avoid redundant symbol loading across conversation turns.
