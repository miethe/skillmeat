## Key Documents

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**
   - Location: `docs/project_plans/initialization/init-prd.md`
   - Defines vision, features, user workflows, and success metrics

2. **Codebase Analysis Report**
   - Generated by Explore subagent
   - 1,682 LOC analyzed across 8 modules
   - Reusability assessment: 85-100% for core components

3. **Architecture Design**
   - Location: `docs/architecture/detailed-architecture.md`
   - Comprehensive module structure, data models, and interfaces
   - Quick reference: `docs/architecture/architecture-summary.md`
   - Data flows: `docs/architecture/data-flow.md`

4. **Implementation Plan**
   - Location: `docs/implementation-plan.md`
   - 9 phases over 8 weeks with detailed tasks and deliverables

---

## Strategic Goals

### Vision
> "Every developer's personal library of Claude configurations, intelligently managed and effortlessly deployed across all their projects."

### MVP Objectives (Phase 1 - 8 Weeks)

1. **Collection-First Architecture**: Move from project-manifest to personal collection model
2. **Multi-Artifact Support**: Skills, Commands, Agents (3 types for MVP)
3. **Deployment System**: Deploy from collection to projects with tracking
4. **Version Management**: Snapshots and rollback capabilities
5. **Upstream Tracking**: Monitor and update from GitHub sources

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Three-Tier System

```
Collection (~/.skillmeat/collection/)
    ↓ deploy
Projects (.claude/ directories)
```

### New Module Structure

```
skillmeat/
├── core/          # Business logic
│   ├── collection.py
│   ├── artifact.py
│   ├── deployment.py
│   ├── sync.py
│   └── version.py
├── sources/       # Pluggable sources
│   ├── base.py
│   ├── github.py
│   └── local.py
├── storage/       # Persistence layer
│   ├── manifest.py
│   ├── lockfile.py
│   └── snapshot.py
└── utils/         # Shared utilities
    ├── metadata.py
    ├── validator.py
    ├── diff.py
    └── filesystem.py
```

### Core Data Models

- **Collection**: Personal library of artifacts
- **Artifact**: Unified representation (Skills, Commands, Agents)
- **Deployment**: Tracking for deployed artifacts
- **Snapshot**: Version history for rollback

---

## Implementation Timeline

| Week | Phase | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Foundation & Data Models | Package structure, models, storage layer |
| 2 | Sources & GitHub | Source abstraction, GitHub/local sources |
| 3-4 | Collection Management | CollectionManager, ArtifactManager |
| 5-6 | Deployment | DeploymentManager, tracking system |
| 6-7 | Versioning | VersionManager, snapshots, rollback |
| 7 | CLI Refactoring | All commands updated to new architecture |
| 8 | Testing & Polish | Tests (>80% coverage), docs, migration tool |

**Total Duration:** 8 weeks
**Estimated Effort:** ~200-240 hours

---

## Reusability Assessment

Based on comprehensive codebase analysis:

| Component | Reusability | Effort to Adapt |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Data Models (`models.py`) | 90% | Low |
| GitHub Integration (`github.py`) | 85% | Medium |
| Installer (`installer.py`) | 95% | Very Low |
| Config Manager (`config.py`) | 100% | None |
| Utilities (`utils.py`) | 90% | Low |
| CLI (`cli.py`) | 40% | High |
| Marketplace (`claude_marketplace.py`) | 50% | Medium |

**Summary:** Core components are production-ready; CLI requires significant refactoring.

## Migration Path

### From skillman to skillmeat

**User Impact:**
- Minimal: Automated migration tool provided
- Skills preserved with upstream tracking
- Configuration migrated automatically

**Migration Command:**
```bash
pip install skillmeat
skillmeat migrate --from-skillman
```

**What Gets Migrated:**
- All installed skills → collection artifacts
- skills.toml → collection.toml
- skills.lock → collection.lock
- Upstream tracking preserved
- Configuration settings

**Backward Compatibility:**
- skillman remains available during transition
- Both can coexist temporarily
- Clear migration documentation

## Conclusion

The skillmeat project has a solid foundation from skillman (85-100% reusability of core components) and a clear architectural vision. The 8-week implementation plan is realistic, well-structured, and designed for execution by subagents working in parallel.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with Phase 1 implementation starting with foundation and module structure.

**Next Action:** Review architecture documents and make final design decisions before beginning implementation.
