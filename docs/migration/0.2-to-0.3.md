# Migration Guide: v0.2.0-alpha → v0.3.0-beta

This guide helps you upgrade from SkillMeat v0.2.0-alpha to v0.3.0-beta.

## Upgrade Status

**Compatibility**: Fully backward compatible
**Breaking Changes**: None
**Data Loss**: None (all existing data preserved)
**Downtime**: No downtime required

## Breaking Changes

### None!

v0.3.0-beta is **completely backward compatible** with v0.2.0-alpha.

- All existing commands continue to work unchanged
- All configurations are automatically compatible
- All collections, artifacts, and deployments persist
- CLI flags and options remain consistent

## Upgrade Steps

### Step 1: Update Package

Install the latest version:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install --upgrade skillmeat==0.3.0-beta

# Or using uv (recommended)
uv tool install --upgrade skillmeat==0.3.0-beta
```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Confirm the upgrade was successful:

```bash
skillmeat --version
# Output: skillmeat, version 0.3.0-beta
```

Check that your collections are still accessible:

```bash
skillmeat list
# Should show all existing artifacts
```

### Step 3: Test Web Interface (Optional)

Try the new web interface:

```bash
skillmeat web dev
# Opens http://localhost:3000 automatically
```

Navigate through:
- Collections dashboard
- Artifact details
- Deploy interface
- Analytics

### Step 4: Explore New Features (Optional)

After upgrading, you can immediately use new features:

```bash
# Try marketplace search
skillmeat marketplace-search productivity

# Check MCP capabilities
skillmeat mcp list

# Export collection as bundle
skillmeat export my-collection
```

## Configuration Updates

### Optional: Add Marketplace Brokers

Create `~/.skillmeat/marketplace.toml` to customize marketplace sources:

```toml
[brokers.skillmeat]
enabled = true
url = "https://marketplace.skillmeat.dev"

[brokers.claudehub]
enabled = true
url = "https://hub.claude.ai/marketplace"

[brokers.custom]
enabled = false
url = "https://your-marketplace.example.com"
```

### Optional: Configure Team Vault

Create `~/.skillmeat/sharing.toml` for team sharing:

```toml
[vault.git]
url = "git@github.com:team/skillmeat-packs.git"
branch = "main"

[vault.s3]
bucket = "team-skillmeat-packs"
region = "us-west-2"
prefix = "bundles/"
```

### Optional: Add MCP Configuration

Create `~/.skillmeat/mcp.toml` for MCP defaults:

```toml
[mcp]
auto-health-check = true
health-check-interval = 300  # seconds
log-parsing-enabled = true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Commands not found

**Symptom**: `skillmeat: command not found`

**Solution**:
1. Verify installation: `pip show skillmeat`
2. Check version: `skillmeat --version`
3. If not installed, run upgrade again: `pip install --upgrade skillmeat==0.3.0-beta`
4. Restart terminal and try again

### Issue: Old configuration not loading

**Symptom**: Collection or artifacts not showing up

**Solution**:
1. Check configuration location: `ls ~/.skillmeat/`
2. Verify collection.toml exists: `ls ~/.skillmeat/collection.toml`
3. List artifacts: `skillmeat list`
4. If still missing, run: `skillmeat config get`

### Issue: Web interface not starting

**Solution**:
1. Check Node.js installed: `node --version` (v18+)
2. Check port 3000 is available: `lsof -i :3000`
3. Try different port: `skillmeat web dev --port 3001`
4. Check logs: `skillmeat web dev --verbose`

### Issue: MCP commands not working

**Symptom**: `mcp` command not found or fails

**Solution**:
1. Verify Claude is installed
2. Check settings.json exists: `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. Verify MCP is configured: `skillmeat mcp list`
4. Check Claude logs: `~/.claude/logs/`

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, you can downgrade to v0.2.0-alpha:

```bash
pip install skillmeat==0.2.0-alpha
```

All v0.3.0 configurations will be preserved and won't affect v0.2.0 operation.

**Important**: Your collections created in v0.3.0 remain compatible with v0.2.0 (no data format changes).

## Database Migrations

v0.3.0-beta includes automatic database migrations for:

- Analytics schema updates (adds new metrics)
- Deployment tracking improvements
- MCP configuration storage
- Marketplace caching tables

These migrations run automatically on first use of each feature.

## Breaking Changes (None!)

Unlike major version upgrades, v0.3.0-beta maintains full backward compatibility:

- No CLI command changes
