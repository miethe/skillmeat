# SkillMeat Documentation Cleanup & Release Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses **25+ policy violations** in the SkillMeat documentation and identifies gaps in release documentation. The goal is to ensure v0.3.0-beta release meets quality standards by enforcing the documentation policy: **only document what is explicitly needed for users and developers.**

**Key Metrics:**
- 25+ files violate documentation policy (session notes, summaries, redundant docs)
- 159 markdown files in `/docs/` (many need review)
- 81 CLI commands need documentation verification
- 15 web pages need documentation verification
- 3 categories of violations: Root level, API tests, Web frontend

---

## Section 1: Cleanup Phase

**Status Snapshot (2025-12-19):**
- Root-level, web frontend, and web test delete targets are already removed.
- Cache watcher documentation moved to developer docs (`docs/developers/cache/WATCHER.md`), to be relocated under `docs/dev/cache/` during consolidation.
- Planned move target is now located at `.claude/worknotes/fixes/2025-11-26_nextjs-build-cache-fix.md`.
- `skillmeat/api/tests/README_PERFORMANCE.md` still needs a final disposition.
- Nine "docs to review" entries still exist and need triage.

### 1.1 Root Level Files (Previously Targeted; Removed)

**Rationale:** These are exploration summaries, session notes, and completion reports that violate the documentation policy. They create noise and become outdated. Implementation details belong in git commits.

| File | Path | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md | `/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Session notes, not user-facing |
| P4-005-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md | `/P4-005-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Phase 4 summary, belongs in git |
| P5-004-SECURITY-REVIEW-COMPLETE.md | `/P5-004-SECURITY-REVIEW-COMPLETE.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Completion report, outdated |
| OBSERVABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md | `/OBSERVABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Completion report |
| EXPLORATION_INDEX.md | `/EXPLORATION_INDEX.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Index of exploration, redundant |
| EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md | `/EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Exploration session notes |
| QUICK_REFERENCE_COMPONENTS.md | `/QUICK_REFERENCE_COMPONENTS.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Should be in docs/ or component docs |
| SMOKE_TEST_REPORT_SID-035.md | `/SMOKE_TEST_REPORT_SID-035.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test report, not documentation |
| CODEBASE_EXPLORATION_REPORT.md | `/CODEBASE_EXPLORATION_REPORT.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Exploration report |
| DIS-5.8-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md | `/DIS-5.8-COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Implementation summary |

**Action:** No action needed (already removed). Keep list for historical reference.

---

### 1.2 API Test Violations (One Review Item Remaining)

**Rationale:** Test result reports and performance summaries are temporary artifacts. Use git commits for test result tracking.

| File | Path | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| ERROR_HANDLING_TEST_RESULTS.md | `/skillmeat/api/tests/ERROR_HANDLING_TEST_RESULTS.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test results report |
| PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md | `/skillmeat/api/tests/PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Performance test report |
| PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md | `/skillmeat/api/tests/PERFORMANCE_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Performance summary |
| LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md | `/skillmeat/api/tests/LOAD_TEST_RESULTS.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Load test report |
| README_PERFORMANCE.md | `/skillmeat/api/tests/README_PERFORMANCE.md` | REVIEW | Check if this contains permanent performance info |

**Action:** Only `README_PERFORMANCE.md` remains for review. Confirm whether it belongs in `docs/ops/testing/` or `docs/ops/performance/` (per consolidation plan), or remove it.

**Keep:** `/skillmeat/api/tests/README.md` (if it exists and documents test structure)

---

### 1.3 Cache Module Documentation

| File | Path | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| WATCHER.md | `docs/developers/cache/WATCHER.md` | KEEP (2025-12-19) | Keep as implementation guide; move to `docs/dev/cache/` in consolidation |

**Action:** No further cleanup needed unless consolidating developer docs paths.

---

### 1.4 Web Frontend Violations (Previously Targeted; Removed)

**Rationale:** Implementation status, architecture docs, and quick starts created during development should be replaced with proper release documentation.

| File | Path | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| IMPLEMENTATION.md | `/skillmeat/web/IMPLEMENTATION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Development notes |
| COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md | `/skillmeat/web/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Architecture notes (move to docs/web-architecture.md if needed) |
| P1-002_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md | `/skillmeat/web/P1-002_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Phase status, outdated |
| COLLECTIONS_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md | `/skillmeat/web/COLLECTIONS_DASHBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Feature implementation notes |
| MARKETPLACE_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md | `/skillmeat/web/MARKETPLACE_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Feature implementation notes |
| MARKETPLACE_QUICK_START.md | `/skillmeat/web/MARKETPLACE_QUICK_START.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Ad-hoc guide, use docs/ location |
| DEPLOY_SYNC_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md | `/skillmeat/web/DEPLOY_SYNC_UI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Feature implementation notes |
| DEPLOY_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md | `/skillmeat/web/DEPLOY_SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Implementation summary |
| ANALYTICS_WIDGETS_IMPLEMENTATION.md | `/skillmeat/web/ANALYTICS_WIDGETS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Feature implementation notes |

**Keep:**
- `/skillmeat/web/README.md` (module documentation)
- `/skillmeat/web/CLAUDE.md` (developer rules)
- `/skillmeat/web/SDK_README_TEMPLATE.md` (if it's a template for users)

---

### 1.5 Web Test Violations (Previously Targeted; Removed)

**Rationale:** Test-specific documentation and quick starts created during test development. Use proper testing docs instead.

| File | Path | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| TASK_COMPLETION.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/TASK_COMPLETION.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test task tracking |
| TASK_SUMMARY.md | `/skillmeat/web/__tests__/notifications/TEST_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test summary report |
| CROSS_BROWSER_TEST_SUMMARY.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/CROSS_BROWSER_TEST_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test summary |
| SKIP_WORKFLOW_TEST_SUMMARY.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/SKIP_WORKFLOW_TEST_SUMMARY.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test summary |
| QUICK_START.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/QUICK_START.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test quick start (move to docs/testing if needed) |
| CROSS_BROWSER_TESTING.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/CROSS_BROWSER_TESTING.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Test guide (move to docs/testing if needed) |
| MARKETPLACE_SOURCES_TESTING.md | `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/MARKETPLACE_SOURCES_TESTING.md` | REMOVED (2025-12-19) | Feature test docs |

**Keep:** `/skillmeat/web/tests/README.md` and `/skillmeat/web/tests/e2e/` if they document test structure/setup.

---

### 1.6 Files to MOVE (Completed)

**Rationale:** Consolidate worknotes into proper `.claude/` tracking structure.

| Current Path | Target Path | Status | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `/docs/worknotes/2025-11-26_nextjs-build-cache-fix.md` | `.claude/worknotes/fixes/2025-11-26_nextjs-build-cache-fix.md` | MOVED (2025-12-19) | Worknote now lives in `.claude` |

**Action:** None.

---

### 1.7 Docs to REVIEW (9 files)

**Rationale:** These may be session notes or daily logs that should either be consolidated or deleted.

| Path | Type | Recommendation |
|------|------|-----------------|
| `docs/project_plans/bugs/bugs-11-25.md` | Session notes | Review & consolidate into bug tracker |
| `docs/project_plans/bugs/bugs-11-29.md` | Session notes | Review & consolidate into bug tracker |
| `docs/project_plans/bugs/bugs-12-02.md` | Session notes | Review & consolidate into bug tracker |

**Action:** NO ACTION. These are identified bugs and should be kept for documentation.

---

### 1.8 Docs Directory Consolidation (Reduce Root-Level Sprawl)

**Goal:** Consolidate `docs/` into four top-level areas:
- `docs/project_plans/` - Roadmaps, PRDs, implementation plans, tracking.
- `docs/user/` - End-user guides, quickstart, CLI/web commands, release notes, migration.
- `docs/dev/` - Developer guides, architecture, API references, design patterns, implementation notes.
- `docs/ops/` - Operational docs (observability, performance, security, legal, testing, runbooks).

**Notes:**
- Keep assets under `docs/user/assets/` (screenshots/videos) to avoid extra top-level directories.
- Prefer merging or nesting rather than keeping parallel roots with overlapping scope.

- Setup & installation guides
- Contributing guidelines
- Architecture & design documentation
- Configuration file documentation
- Testing documentation
- Release notes & changelogs

**Tracking Documentation** (belongs in `.claude/`):

---

### 6.2 Content Guidelines

**KEEP Only:**
- Information users or developers need to understand/use the system
- Information that changes infrequently
- Information with clear ownership
- Information with current examples

**DELETE/MOVE:**
- Session notes and ad-hoc updates
- Temporary tracking (use git commits)
- Outdated examples and broken links
- Feature status (use git commits or issue tracker)
- Implementation notes (use git commits)

---

### 6.3 Quality Standards

All documentation in `/docs/` must include:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description of purpose"
created_at: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft|published|deprecated
priority: low|medium|high
audience: developers|users|maintainers
category: guides|architecture|api|etc
tags:
  - relevant-tags
---
```

---

## Section 7: Risk Assessment

### 7.1 Risks of Not Cleaning Up

- **User Confusion:** Outdated docs lead to errors and support requests
- **Maintenance Burden:** More files to update as features change
- **Search Noise:** 25+ irrelevant files clutter documentation search
- **Release Credibility:** Exploration reports suggest incomplete work
- **Policy Non-Compliance:** Violates stated documentation guidelines

---

### 7.2 Risks of Deletion

- **Loss of Context:** Implementation details may be valuable for maintainers
