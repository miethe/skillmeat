## Bug List

1. [] When navigating to /projects, away, and then back, the metadata regarding number of artifacts per project and LAst deployed time are both set to 0 and Never, respectively; the same occurs on the modal when clicking on a Project. However, when navigating to /projects/{id} page, the details are correct. This appears to be a caching issue where the summary data is not being properly fetched or updated when returning to the /projects page, once the data has been cached.
2. [] Navigating to the /sharing page breaks the site with a TypeError:

    ```log
    Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')

    components/sharing/bundle-list.tsx (98:91) @ eval


    96 |                     <div className="min-w-0 flex-1">
    97 |                       <div className="mb-1 flex items-center gap-2">
    >  98 |                         <h3 className="truncate text-base font-semibold">{bundle.metadata.name}</h3>
    ```
3. [] When viewing an artifact modal on the Sync Status tab, if the contents of Diff Viewer extend vertically or horizontally beyond the viewport, it is not possible to see the full content.
    - The Diff Viewer should allow scrolling within its own area, independent of the modal or page scroll.
    - The scrollbar should be for the Diff Viewer area specifically, allowing the buttons and other details at the bottom of the modal to remain visible at all times without scrolling.
    - There should be independent scrollbars for both the left and right panes of the Diff Viewer (file tree and content viewer), allowing users to scroll through each side separately when needed. The scrollbars should only appear when the content exceeds the visible area.
4. [] When viewing an artifact modal on the Contents tab, if viewing a file and the user clicks Edit, the Preview pane is cut off horizontally.
    - When in Edit-mode for a file, the filetree sidebar should collapse to a narrower view, showing only icons, to allow more horizontal space for the file content area.
    - The Preview pane itself should be fully visible, with the contents within being scrollable if they exceed the visible area both horizontally and vertically. Currently it only scrolls vertically.
    - Similarly, the header for the file tree, labeled "FILES", is always cut off so that only 'ES' is visible; this should be fixed to ensure the full label is always readable.
