## Bug List

1. [] On the tab "Sync Status" in the artifact modal:
    - For collection-level artifacts, the "Sync Upstream" button is non-functional.
    - For all artifacts, the "Deploy to Project" button always request selecting a project to deploy to, but there is no field to do so.
    - Both buttons should trigger the appropriate sync operations based on the artifact's level.
    - Toggling a project under "Project Comparison" seem to have no effect when viewing an collection-level artifact, other than changing the arrow to point down. This should update the diff view to compare against the selected project.
      - "Upstream Status" should show the diff for current-level against source. ie if viewing an artifact from /manage or /collection, it should compare collection against source. If viewing from /projects/{ID}/manage, it should compare against the deployed project version.
      - Each project listed under "Project Comparison" should allow toggling to view the diff against that deployed project version. There should be a toggle to switch between source and collection diffs.
  - Notes:
    - The above would enable full sync functionality from the modal for all 3 levels of artifacts, regardless of which is currently being viewed, allowing users to sync up/downstream as needed.
