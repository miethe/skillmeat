# Bugs and Issues

**Date:** November 25, 2025

## Guidance

Remember to follow all app guidance while remediating bugs. This includes:

- Validate every fix where applicable with both unit tests (if available) and E2E tests. All web app fixes should be validated via chrome-devtools.
- You should add a very brief note per bug fix in the monthly bug fixes doc:

  ```markdown
    ### {BUG DESCRIPTIVE TITLE}

    **Issue**: {Explanation of the bug.}
    - **Date**: {Must validate current date via tool call, ie `bash: `date +%Y-%m-%d``}
    - **Location**: `{filepath:line number or component name}`
    - **Root Cause**: {Brief explanation of the root cause.}
    - **Fix**: {Brief explanation of the fix.}
    - **Tests**: {Brief explanation of tests added or updated to validate the fix.}
    - **Commit**: {Commit id}
    ```

- NO other docs should be created (or must be removed before commit) except the update to the above-noted monthly bug fixes doc, unless explicitly called for in the bug fix itself. You may update existing user/developer docs when relevant from the fix.

## Bug List

1. [x] Artifact modals are different between /manage, /collection, /projects/{ID}
    - The modals for artifacts should be consistent across the entire app. Currently, the modals in /manage and /collection have different tabs and contents, which is confusing for users.
    - The contents of the modals will be different between instance-level artifacts and project-level artifacts, but the overall structure and layout should be the same.
    - It should be very clear to the user when they are viewing or editing an artifact at the instance level vs the project level.

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: 8ddee43
    - Fix: Replaced ArtifactDetail component with UnifiedEntityModal on /collection page to ensure consistent modal appearance and behavior across all pages.

2. [x] Artifact "Sync with Upstream" has no noticeable function
    - The "Sync with Upstream" button in the artifact modals from /projects/{ID}/manage does kick-off numerous successful API calls/traces.
    - There does not appear to be any function to the underlying artifact after clicking the button. ie if syncing a skill, the skill does not appear to have any updated data or changes.

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: ee182fc
    - Fix: Implemented upstream GitHub sync functionality in the artifacts.py API endpoint to properly fetch and update artifact data from upstream sources.

3. [x] Accessing Project Entity Management is confusing
    - Currently, a user must press Manage Entities on a Project page to manage those entities.
    - Instead, clicking on a Deployed Artifact on the /projects/{ID} page should open the management modal for that artifact directly. This modal should be identical to all others on the site as noted in Bug 1 above, but with an obvious indicator that the user is managing a project-level artifact.

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: 8ddee43
    - Fix: Updated projects/[id]/page.tsx to use UnifiedEntityModal with proper entity conversion, allowing users to click deployed artifacts to open the management modal directly.

4. [x] Instance-level artifacts seem to not be able to be synced.
    - The Sync Status tab in the artifact modal should allow users to sync artifacts up or down-stream, depending on the artifact's level. However, currently these functions do not appear to work for instance-level artifacts.
    - Project-level artifacts can only sync w/ Upstream (which doesn't seem to function per Bug 3 above), but don't allow the user to determine which to keep, etc.

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: ee182fc
    - Fix: Implemented upstream GitHub sync in artifacts.py API endpoint, which now works for both instance-level and project-level GitHub artifacts.

5. [x] Trying to do `skillmeat show {artifact_name}` in the CLI throws an error.
    - `Error: ArtifactManager.show() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'`

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: ba9a0e6
    - Fix: Changed the parameter name from `name=` to `artifact_name=` in cli.py to match the ArtifactManager.show() method signature.

6. [x] Adding artifacts via CLI which are individual files (ie agents, commands) requires the file extension, but then adds that to the name.
    - For example, `skillmeat add agent vijaythecoder/awesome-claude-agents/agents/specialized/react/react-component-architect.md` adds an artifact named `react-component-architect.md` instead of `react-component-architect`.
    - All artifacts should strip the file extension from the name when adding via CLI or web app.
    - Adding artifacts via CLI or web app should attempt to find a relevant file at a given path, even if the user does not provide the file extension.

    **Resolution**
    - Status: RESOLVED
    - Commit: ba9a0e6
    - Fix: Changed from using Path.name to Path.stem in artifact.py to automatically strip file extensions from artifact names.
