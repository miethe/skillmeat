# Enhancements and Other Ideas

**Date:** November 30, 2025

## Idea List

1. Auto-sync across multiple projects
    - Implement a feature that allows users to sync artifacts across multiple projects simultaneously.
    - This would be useful for users managing several related projects that share common artifacts, allowing them to update all relevant projects with a single action.
    - Could include options to select which projects to sync, and whether to sync all artifacts or only specific ones.
