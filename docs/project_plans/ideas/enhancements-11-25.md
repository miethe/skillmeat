# Enhancements and Other Ideas

**Date:** November 25, 2025

## Idea List

1. Auto-scanning for artifact imports
    - Implement a feature that automatically scans project directories for existing artifacts in `.claude`, ie existing skills, agents, etc, and notify users and ask if they'd like to import them.
    - Would default to local installs, but could have a bulk import screen with a table of all artifacts being imported, allowing user to add sources and other parameters/edits before confirming import.
      - Could do the same for individual imports, and should allow after-the-fact edits to artifact parameters.
2.
