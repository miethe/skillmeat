## ✨ New Features in Detail

### 1. Notification System
Real-time notifications for all operations with persistent history:

- **Multiple notification types**: import results, sync results, errors, and info messages
- **Persistent history** with localStorage (max 50 notifications)
- **Expandable details** for import results showing success/failure breakdown

- **Full groups support** - organize artifacts within collections into logical groups
- **Drag-and-drop reordering** of artifacts within groups
- **ManageGroupsDialog** for creating, editing, and deleting groups
- **CRUD API endpoints** for programmatic group management

### 3. Groups Functionality
Powerful artifact organization system with full REST API:
- **Backend**: SQLAlchemy models with Group and GroupArtifact relationship tables
- **API endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/groups` - Create new group
  - `GET /api/v1/groups` - List all groups with pagination
  - `GET /api/v1/groups/{id}` - Get group details
  - `PUT /api/v1/groups/{id}` - Update group metadata

### 4. Persistent Project Cache
Lightning-fast project loading with intelligent caching:
- **SQLite database** at `~/.skillmeat/cache.db` (replaces in-memory cache)
- **Thread-safe operations** with proper connection pooling

- **Performance**: Project load time reduced from 1+ minutes to <100ms (95%+ cache hit rate)
- **Alembic migrations** for schema evolution and versioning
- **Smart invalidation** - automatic refresh on file changes detected by FSEvents/watchdog

### 5. Marketplace GitHub Ingestion
GitHub-backed marketplace with artifact ingestion workflow:
- **MarketplaceSource** model for registering GitHub marketplace providers
- **Automated ingestion** of artifacts from GitHub repositories
- **Search and filtering** across marketplace sources
- **REST API** endpoints for marketplace source CRUD operations
- **Web UI** at `/marketplace` for browsing available artifacts

### 6. Agent Context Entities
Built-in artifact content hashing and validation:
- **Backend CRUD** via Artifact model filtering with validation
- **Content-aware operations** with SHA-256 hashing for integrity
- **CLI support** via `skillmeat context` command group
- **Web UI** at `/context-entities` for managing context artifacts
- **Validation** ensures consistent artifact content before deployment

### 7. Artifact Flow Modal Redesign
Improved user experience for artifact operations:
- **Unified modal design** for all artifact operations (create, edit, view)
- **Better error handling** with inline validation feedback
- **Improved sync status tab** showing real-time operation progress
- **Streamlined workflow** for common operations

### 8. Tags Refactor v1
Complete tagging system with REST API and UI components:
- **CRUD API endpoints** for tag management:
  - `POST /api/v1/tags` - Create tag

- **Versioning & Merge System** - Core backend and API implemented, comprehensive testing deferred to v0.4.0

### Other Known Issues
- Zip bomb detection not yet implemented (scheduled for v0.4.0)
- Dependency lock file generation pending (scheduled for v0.4.0)
- MCP environment variable warnings could be more prominent
- Single-region deployment (multi-region planned for v1.0)

### Recent Fixes
- **LocalStorage SSR Compatibility** - Fixed hydration warnings when using notifications and collection context in Next.js SSR
- **Collections API Endpoint Correction** - Changed from `/collections` (read-only) to `/user-collections` for mutations (POST/PUT/DELETE)
- **Discovery Cache Invalidation** - Fixed stale cache issues after artifact operations
- **Import Status Mismatch** - Corrected distinction between failed imports (errors) and skipped imports (already exists)
- **Marketplace Re-import Fix** - Deleting an imported artifact now resets the catalog entry status, allowing re-import. Added "Force Re-import" action for updating imported artifacts from upstream
